# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is part of the Kaggle Titanic competition to predict passenger survival using machine learning.

## Project Overview
- **Data**: Using `train.csv` and `test.csv` from Kaggle.
- **Analysis (EDA)**: Explored the data with visualizations (e.g., survival by gender and class).
- **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and encoded categorical features.
- **Model**: Logistic Regression with 0.81 accuracy on training data.
- **Result**: Final Kaggle score: 0.76555.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download `train.csv` and `test.csv` from the [Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
2. Open and run `titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
